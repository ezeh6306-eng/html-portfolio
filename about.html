<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate Web Developer who loves turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly digital experiences. 
    With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React (or Vue/Angular if you prefer), 
    I build responsive, fast, and visually appealing websites that deliver real value.</p>
<p>My focus is on clean code, seamless user experience, and performance-driven design.
         Whether it’s creating a sleek front-end interface or working on the logic behind the scenes,
          I enjoy every part of the development process.</p>
<p>I’m constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web landscape
     — because for me, coding isn’t just work, it’s a craft I’m always improving.</p>          
<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me learning something new, experimenting with side projects,
     or helping others solve tech problems.</p>
